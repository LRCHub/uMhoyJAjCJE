[00:09.09] Daughter of darkness
[00:10.82] Death's possession
[00:13.54] Orion is over your head now
[00:19.88] For the faithless, the misery-laden
[00:25.55] Orion is over your head now
[00:31.83] Behind the moon, alongside hunger
[00:36.33] Kissing her with candle light
[00:39.08] Orion is over your head now
[00:42.75] It's the stillness, no second chances, evocation
[00:47.25] Orion is over her head now
[00:53.57] Over her head now
[00:58.92] Orion is over her head now
